# depend-encyinject-OnMe
Can you be overly dependent on someone?  Not when it comes to OO programming!

As well as being built on dependency injection this framwork will allow classes with dependencies to be instantiated dynamically.  With DI in mind we can build a world where we are forced to think about what an object will need, and only allow it to be created when those needs are satisfied.  By coupling this with simple interface design we can easily achieve encapsulation allowing us to quickly change and modify our objects without having to re-build our dependant classes.

Of course, to make the dependencies dynamic someone has to know what we will expect to find for our class.  In order to save long config files this framework includes dependency checkers which can be used to create a record of and/or instantiate the dependancies (depending on how you choose to implement your interface).  While this does mean remembering to add in the reference when we build a new class, this (hopefully) encourages more thoughful design.  Thankfully if you do forget, the missing dependency will make itself apparent very quickly and with a clear error message - yet another reason to embrace Dependency Injection in your life!
